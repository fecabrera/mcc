# mcc

A small, modern-C-style language with generics, structs, and pointers,
compiled to native code (or JIT-executed) via [LLVM](https://llvm.org/)
using [llvmlite](https://llvmlite.readthedocs.io/). The compiler lives in
the [mcc/](mcc/) package, with one module per stage: lexer, parser, code
generator, and driver.

```c
import "libc/stdio";

fn main() -> int32 {
    printf("hello, world\n");

    return 0;
}
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.14 (see [Pipfile](Pipfile))
- llvmlite
- A C compiler on `PATH` (`cc`) for linking native executables

## Install

### Homebrew

```bash
brew tap fecabrera/mcc
brew install mcc
mcc program.mc --run
```

Or in one shot: `brew install fecabrera/mcc/mcc`.

If you have `HOMEBREW_REQUIRE_TAP_TRUST` set, run `brew trust fecabrera/mcc`
once after tapping.

### pip

The compiler is a regular Python package that installs an `mcc` command and
bundles the [standard library](lib/README.md):

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fecabrera/mcc
mcc examples/helloworld.mc --run
```

### From source

For development, work in a checkout with [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/):

```bash
pipenv install
pipenv run python -m mcc examples/helloworld.mc --run
```

`pipenv run python -m mcc` and an installed `mcc` are interchangeable; the
examples below use the `mcc` command.

## Usage

```bash
mcc examples/helloworld.mc              # compile to a native executable
mcc examples/helloworld.mc -o hello     # choose the output name
mcc examples/helloworld.mc --run        # JIT-compile and run immediately
mcc examples/helloworld.mc --emit-llvm  # print the LLVM IR instead of compiling
mcc examples/helloworld.mc -O3          # optimization level (0-3, default 2)
mcc main.mc -I vendor -I deps           # extra import search paths
mcc main.mc --naked                     # don't put lib/ on the import path
mcc main.mc --target aarch64-unknown-none-elf   # cross-compile to an object file
mcc main.mc --general-regs-only         # never use FP/SIMD registers
```

`--target` accepts any LLVM triple and emits an object file instead of a
host executable; link it with that target's toolchain (e.g.
`aarch64-elf-gcc`). See [examples/baremetal/](examples/baremetal/) for a
freestanding kernel built this way.

`--general-regs-only` keeps generated code off the floating-point and SIMD
registers — the equivalent of gcc's `-mgeneral-regs-only`. It stops the
backend from quietly using a vector register (say, to copy a struct) in
code that must not touch FP state, such as a kernel or an interrupt
handler. Supported for aarch64, x86, and riscv targets.

## Examples

[examples/](examples/) is a runnable tour of the whole language — one
feature per file, from hello world through unsigned arithmetic and generics
to fizzbuzz and a prime sieve. See the [index](examples/README.md).

## Language reference

### Functions

Functions are declared with `fn`. Parameters are typed, and the return type
follows `->`; omitting it means `void`. `main` gets an implicit `return 0`
if it falls off the end.

```c
fn add(a: int32, b: int32) -> int32 {
    return a + b;
}

fn greet() {
    puts("hi");
}
```

Recursion works:

```c
fn fib(n: int32) -> int32 {
    if (n < 2) {
        return n;
    }
    return fib(n - 1) + fib(n - 2);
}
```

### Variadic functions

A trailing `...` after at least one named parameter makes a function
variadic, both in [`@extern` declarations](#extern-declarations) (C's
`printf`) and in functions you define. A defined variadic function can
**forward** its extra arguments to a C `v*` function (`vsnprintf`,
`vfprintf`, …) through a `va_list`:

```c
import "libc/stdio";   // @extern fn vsnprintf(..., args: va_list) -> int32;

fn logf(fmt: uint8*, ...) -> int32 {
    let buf: uint8[256];
    let ap: va_list;
    va_start(ap, fmt);                       // ap, then the last named param
    let n = vsnprintf(&buf[0], 256, fmt, ap);
    va_end(ap);
    puts(&buf[0]);
    return n;
}

logf("%s = %d (0x%X)", "answer", 42, 255);   // answer = 42 (0xFF)
```

`va_list` is the C argument-cursor type; `va_start(ap, last)` initializes it
(naming the parameter just before the `...`), and `va_end(ap)` releases it.
Its layout is platform-specific, so `va_list` is opaque — you can hand it to
a function but not read individual arguments from it in mcc (there is no
`va_arg`); let a C `v*` function consume it. The right layout is chosen for
the target (it works for x86-64, arm64/aarch64, and Apple arm64).

### Generics

Functions can take type parameters, declared in `<...>` after the name and
usable anywhere a type is expected:

```c
fn sum<T>(a: T, b: T) -> T {
    return a + b;
}

fn main() -> int32 {
    let a: uint8 = sum<uint8>(1, 2);   // explicit instantiation
    let x: int64 = 9000000000;
    let y: int64 = sum(x, 1);          // T inferred from the arguments
    return 0;
}
```

Generics compile by monomorphization: each distinct set of type arguments
stamps out its own specialized function (`sum<uint8>`, `sum<int64>`, ...),
generated on first use and reused after that — there is no boxing or runtime
dispatch. When type arguments are omitted, they are inferred from the
argument types (variables take priority over literals), and typed arguments
that disagree are an error: `conflicting types for type parameter T`.
Generic functions can call themselves recursively. See
[examples/generics.mc](examples/generics.mc).

Generic functions with the same name form an _overload set_, dispatched by
parameter pattern — a call picks the most specific viable variant (`T*`
beats `T`, `box<T>*` beats both). This is how libraries specialize by type
shape: [lib/hash.mc](lib/hash.mc) hashes integer keys by value (splitmix64)
and pointer keys by content (FNV-1a), and [lib/set.mc](lib/set.mc) simply
calls `hash(key)`:

```c
fn hash<T>(key: T) -> uint64 { return splitmix64(key); }
fn hash<T>(key: T*) -> uint64 { return fnv1a(key); }
```

Imported files can extend an overload set with new variants. Two equally
specific viable variants make the call ambiguous — a compile error.

### Variables

`let` declares a variable; the type is inferred from the initializer when
the initializer already has a definite type. A bare integer constant does
not -- it must be given a type with an annotation or a cast, so declarations
are never ambiguous. Assignment uses plain `=`.

```c
let x: int64 = 0;       // annotated
let y = 0 as int64;     // or typed by a cast
let z = 0;              // error: type of 'z' is ambiguous

let pi = 3.14;          // fine: float64 (the only float type)
let ok = true;          // fine: bool
let w = x + 1;          // fine: int64, from x
x = x + 1;
```

A declaration may omit the initializer if it has a type annotation. Like a
C local, the variable holds garbage until assigned — reading it first is
undefined:

```c
let n: int32;           // declared, not yet initialized
if (fancy()) { n = 1; } else { n = 2; }

let p: struct point;    // works for structs too: fill in the fields
p.x = 4;
p.y = 2;
```

Variables are block-scoped, as in C: a `let` is visible only until the end of
its enclosing `{ }` — including the body of an `if`/`else` branch or a
`while`/`until` loop — so sibling and sequential blocks can reuse a name. An
inner block may **shadow** a variable from an outer one; the outer binding
returns when the block ends. Redeclaring a name in the *same* block is an
error.

```c
let x: int32 = 1;
if (cond) {
    let x: int32 = 2;   // shadows the outer x, only within this block
    use(x);             // 2
}
use(x);                 // 1 again

while (i < n) {
    let row = grid[i];  // fresh each iteration; not visible after the loop
    i = i + 1;
}
```

A bare `{ }` is a statement too, so you can open a scope anywhere — handy for a
short-lived local (and its `defer`) without leaking it into the rest of the
function:

```c
{
    let tmp = alloc<uint8>(64);
    defer dealloc(tmp);
    fill(tmp);
}   // tmp is freed and out of scope here
```

### Constants

`const` declares a named compile-time constant — mcc's answer to C's
`#define NAME value`, but typed and scoped rather than textual. It has **no
storage**: each use is folded in at compile time.

```c
const DEBUG = 1;             // untyped int: adapts like a literal
const MAX_USERS: uint64 = 1024;
const GREETING = "hello";

let buf: int32[MAX_USERS];   // an integer const can size an array
```

The initializer must be a constant expression — literals, other constants,
`sizeof`, casts, and integer/float arithmetic — evaluated when the program
is compiled:

```c
const WIDTH  = 80;
const HEIGHT = 24;
const CELLS  = WIDTH * HEIGHT;       // 1920, folded
const ROW_BYTES = WIDTH * sizeof(int32);
```

An untyped integer const stays *adaptable* like a literal, so it takes on
whatever integer type the context needs (`uint64`, `int32`, …) without a
cast. Add an annotation (`const N: uint8 = 4;`) to pin the type. Constants
follow the same [visibility](#visibility) rules as other declarations:
file-scoped names are shared across the program, and `@private` keeps one to
its file. Assigning to a const, or using a non-constant initializer, is a
compile error.

#### Target facts

The compiler predefines two integer constants describing the target it is
building for, derived from the [target triple](#usage) (the host triple when
no `--target` is given):

| Constant      | Values |
| ------------- | ------ |
| `TARGET_OS`   | `OS_DARWIN`, `OS_LINUX`, `OS_WINDOWS`, `OS_NONE`, `OS_UNKNOWN` |
| `TARGET_ARCH` | `ARCH_X86_64`, `ARCH_AARCH64`, `ARCH_RISCV64`, `ARCH_UNKNOWN` |

The `OS_*`/`ARCH_*` names are constants too, so code can branch on them to pick
platform-specific bindings — for instance, the linker symbol behind a libc
stream (see [`@symbol`](#extern-declarations)):

```c
@extern @symbol("__stdoutp") let macos_stdout: struct FILE*;   // when TARGET_OS == OS_DARWIN
@extern @symbol("stdout")    let linux_stdout: struct FILE*;   // when TARGET_OS == OS_LINUX
```

`OS_NONE` is a freestanding target with no operating system: a bare-metal
triple like `aarch64-unknown-none-elf` reports `TARGET_OS == OS_NONE` and
`TARGET_ARCH == ARCH_AARCH64`. Such code uses no libc, so it never needs the
stream symbols above — but `TARGET_ARCH` still lets a kernel select
architecture-specific code (MMIO addresses, register layouts). These names are
reserved: a user `const` may read them but not redefine them.

### Conditional compilation

`@if` selects code at compile time, the way C's `#if` does — but it is
*structured*, not textual: each branch is a real brace-delimited block of the
surrounding grammar, not an arbitrary span of tokens. Only the live branch is
compiled; the dead branch is parsed (so it must be syntactically valid) but
never type-checked or emitted.

The condition is a constant expression over the [target facts](#target-facts) —
`TARGET_OS`, `TARGET_ARCH`, and the `OS_*`/`ARCH_*` constants — with
comparisons, `and`/`or`/`!`, and integer arithmetic. A nonzero result is true.

It works at the top level, to select whole declarations — the intended use is
binding a symbol that differs by platform (see [`@symbol`](#extern-declarations)):

```c
struct FILE {}

@if (TARGET_OS == OS_DARWIN) {
    @extern @symbol("__stdoutp") let stdout: struct FILE*;
} @else @if (TARGET_OS == OS_LINUX) {
    @extern @symbol("stdout")    let stdout: struct FILE*;
} @else {
    @extern let stdout: struct FILE*;
}
```

and as a statement, to select code inside a function. As a statement it does
*not* open a scope — the chosen statements are spliced in inline, so a binding
they declare is visible afterwards:

```c
fn page_size() -> uint64 {
    @if (TARGET_ARCH == ARCH_AARCH64) {
        let size = 16384 as uint64;     // Apple silicon
    } @else {
        let size = 4096 as uint64;
    }
    return size;
}
```

`@else @if` chains, and blocks may nest. `import` is not allowed inside an `@if`
(imports must precede all declarations). Note `@if`/`@else` are compile-time and
distinct from the runtime `if`/`else`.

### Control flow

```c
if (x > 10) {
    puts("big");
} else if (x > 5) {
    puts("medium");
} else {
    puts("small");
}

while (x < 10) {
    x = x + 1;
}

until (x == 0) {     // inverse of while: stops when the condition is true
    x = x - 1;
}

while (true) {
    x = next();
    if (x == 0) { continue; }   // skip to the next iteration
    if (x < 0)  { break; }      // leave the loop
    handle(x);
}
```

Conditions accept `bool` or any integer (compared against zero, as in C).
A body that is a single statement does not need braces:
`if (x > 10) return x;`
`break` and `continue` apply to the innermost enclosing loop.

`for x in obj` iterates anything that supplies the **iter/next protocol** — a
pair of overloads the compiler resolves by type:

```c
fn iter<T>(self: struct array<T>*) -> struct array_iter<T>;   // make a cursor
fn next<T>(it: struct array_iter<T>*, out: T*) -> bool;        // false when done
```

```c
for v in &nums {            // nums: array<int32>; v is int32, inferred from next
    if (v < 0) { continue; }
    if (v > 99) { break; }
    use(v);
}
```

The element type of `x` is inferred from `next`'s out-parameter; `x` is scoped
to the loop and `break`/`continue` work as usual. It lowers to
`{ let it = iter(obj); while (next(&it, &x)) { ... } }` with the iterator held
as a hidden, collision-proof temporary. Define `iter`/`next` overloads for your
own types to make them iterable — [lib/array.mc](lib/array.mc) does this; see
[examples/iteration.mc](examples/iteration.mc).

`case` matches a value against a series of `when` arms, with an optional
`else:` default. The subject is evaluated once, and there is **no
fall-through** — a matching arm runs only its own statements and then the
`case` is done:

```c
case (c) {
    when 'a': handle_a();
    when 'b': handle_b();        // arms hold any number of statements
    else:     handle_other();
}
```

A `when` value may be any expression of the subject's type (untyped
constants adapt to it), and the subject can be any type comparable with
`==` — integers, `uint8` characters, pointers, `bool`, or `float64`.
`break` and `continue` inside an arm act on the enclosing loop, not the
`case`; the no-fall-through semantics mean `break` is never needed to end
an arm.

### Defer

`defer` schedules a statement (or a `{ }` block) to run when the enclosing
block exits — by *any* path: falling off the end, a `return`, or a
`break`/`continue` out of a loop. It keeps a resource's release next to its
acquisition, so cleanup can't be forgotten on an early exit:

```c
fn process() -> int32 {
    let buffer: uint8* = alloc<uint8>(4096);
    defer dealloc(buffer);          // freed however this function returns

    if (bad()) {
        return -1;                  // buffer is still freed
    }
    use(buffer);
    return 0;                       // and here too
}
```

Multiple defers run in **reverse order** (last deferred, first to run), so
resources unwind in the opposite order they were acquired. The block form
groups several actions:

```c
let a = open(...);
defer close(a);
let b = open(...);
defer close(b);
defer {                            // runs first: close(b), then close(a)
    flush();
    sync();
}
```

A defer is tied to the block it appears in, so one inside an `if` or a loop
body fires at the end of that block — each loop iteration runs its own. The
deferred code is evaluated when it runs, not when it is scheduled, so it sees
the latest values of the variables it names (unlike Go, which snapshots the
arguments). A returned value is computed *before* the defers run, so freeing a
buffer in a defer can't clobber what you return. See
[examples/defer.mc](examples/defer.mc).

### Types

| Type                                                  | LLVM equivalent                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `int8`, `int16`, `int32`, `int64`                     | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` (signed)                                |
| `uint8`, `uint16`, `uint32`, `uint64`                 | `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64` (unsigned)                              |
| `bool`                                                | `i1`                                                              |
| `float64`                                             | `double`                                                          |
| `T*` (any type + `*`s)                                | pointer                                                           |
| `T[N]` (fixed-size [array](#arrays))                  | `[N x T]`                                                         |
| `fn(A) -> R` ([function pointer](#function-pointers)) | `R (A)*`                                                          |
| `void`                                                | `void` (return type only; `void*` is not allowed -- use `uint8*`) |

Literals with a decimal point are `float64` and `true`/`false` are `bool`.
Integer literals are written in decimal or hexadecimal (`0xFF`), and are
_untyped constants_: they adapt to the integer type
they are used with as long as the value fits (so `let x: uint64 = 5;` and
`x % 7` both work; `let y: uint8 = 300;` is a compile error). Where no
context provides a type -- most notably `let` without an annotation -- an
untyped constant is a compile error rather than silently becoming `int32`.
Constant integer arithmetic folds at compile time and stays untyped
(`10 * sizeof(int64)` is a `uint64` because `sizeof` is typed; `2 + 3` is
still untyped). There are no other implicit conversions: operands of a
binary operator must have the same type.

Signedness changes behavior, not representation: unsigned types use unsigned
division, remainder, and comparisons, and zero-extend instead of sign-extend
when promoted. Unary `-` is not allowed on unsigned values. See
[examples/unsigned.mc](examples/unsigned.mc).

### Operators

By descending precedence: unary `-` `!` `*` `&`, `as` casts, then `*` `/`
`%`, `+` `-`, shifts `<<` `>>`, bitwise `&`, `^`, `|`, comparisons
`<` `<=` `>` `>=`, `==` `!=`, then `and`, and loosest of all `or`.
Comparisons yield `bool`; `%` and the bitwise/shift operators are
integer-only. `>>` is an arithmetic shift for signed types and logical for
unsigned. Unlike C, bitwise operators bind tighter than comparisons, so
`a & 4 == 4` means `(a & 4) == 4`. Integer constant expressions fold at
compile time.

`and` and `or` are the logical operators (there is no `&&` / `||`). They
short-circuit — the right side is evaluated only when the left does not
already decide the result — take a `bool` or integer on each side (non-zero
is true, as in a condition), and yield a `bool`. They bind looser than
comparisons, so parentheses are usually unnecessary:

```c
if (a > 0 or a < 0 and b < 0) { ... }   // a > 0 or (a < 0 and b < 0)
if (p != null and p->ready) { ... }     // p->ready read only when p != null
```

### Casts

`expr as type` converts explicitly (there are no implicit conversions
between variables):

```c
let a: int32 = 300;
let b = a as uint8;        // truncates: 44
let c = a as int64;        // sign-extends (zero-extends from unsigned types)
let d = a as float64;      // 300.0
let e = 3.99 as int32;     // truncates toward zero: 3
let p = malloc(4) as int32*;  // pointer casts
let n = p as uint64;       // pointer <-> integer
```

`as` binds tighter than binary operators: `a + b as int64` is
`a + (b as int64)`.

### Pointers

`T*` is a pointer to `T`. `&x` takes a variable's address, `*p` dereferences
(both to read and to assign), and `p[i]` indexes:

```c
fn bump(p: int32*) {
    *p = *p + 1;
}

fn main() -> int32 {
    let x = 41;
    bump(&x);                                  // x is now 42

    let nums = malloc(5 * sizeof(int32)) as int32*;
    nums[0] = 7;
    free(nums);
    return 0;
}
```

`sizeof(type)` is a compile-time `uint64` constant (pointers are 8 bytes).
`uint8*` doubles as the raw-memory pointer (C's `void*`): any pointer
implicitly coerces to it, which is why `free(nums)` works without a cast.
String literals have type `uint8*`, so `"hi"[0]` is the byte `104`. There is
no pointer arithmetic (`p + 1`); use `&p[1]`. See
[examples/pointers.mc](examples/pointers.mc) and
[lib/memory.mc](lib/memory.mc) for a generic typed allocator.

### Function pointers

`fn(A, B) -> R` is the type of a pointer to a function taking `A, B` and
returning `R` (a missing `-> R` means `void`, as in a declaration). A bare
function name — written without the call parentheses — is a value of that
type, so functions can be stored in variables and struct fields, passed as
arguments, and returned:

```c
fn add(a: int32, b: int32) -> int32 { return a + b; }
fn sub(a: int32, b: int32) -> int32 { return a - b; }

fn apply(op: fn(int32, int32) -> int32, x: int32, y: int32) -> int32 {
    return op(x, y);            // call through the parameter
}

fn main() -> int32 {
    let op: fn(int32, int32) -> int32 = add;
    op = sub;                                    // reassignable
    return apply(op, 10, 3) + apply(add, 1, 1);
}
```

The signature must match exactly — `add` does not fit a `fn(int32) -> int32`.
`null` is a valid function pointer and they compare with `==` / `!=`, so an
optional callback works:

```c
if (cb != null) { cb(x); }
```

Any expression of function-pointer type is callable, not just a variable —
a struct field, an array element, or the result of another call:

```c
widget->on_click(x);   // a callback stored in a struct
table[i](x);           // an entry in a dispatch table
chooser()(x);          // the function a call returned
```

In a type, `*` binds to the return type, so `fn(int32) -> int32*` is a
function returning `int32*`. Group with parentheses for a pointer to a
function pointer: `(fn(int32) -> int32)*`, e.g. an array of callbacks.

A function value is a pointer underneath, so it casts like one: `add as
uint64` is the function's address as an integer, `addr as fn(...) -> R`
turns an address back into a callable pointer, and it bitcasts to/from a
data pointer such as `uint8*`.

Only a single, non-generic function has an address; a generic name like
`id` cannot be used as a value (there is no one instance to point at).

### Arrays

`T[N]` is a fixed-size array of `N` elements, laid out inline. A local one
is stack-allocated; `@static` makes a zero-initialized file-scoped buffer.
Index with `[]`, and `sizeof` reports the whole array's bytes:

```c
fn main() -> int32 {
    let squares: int32[5];                 // five int32s on the stack
    let i: int32 = 0;
    while (i < 5) { squares[i] = i * i; i = i + 1; }
    return squares[4];                      // sizeof(int32[5]) == 20
}
```

An array literal `[a, b, c]` (a trailing comma is allowed) initializes an
array, nesting for more dimensions. The outermost dimension can be left as
`[]` and is inferred from the literal's length:

```c
let primes: int32[] = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11];          // length inferred as 5
let grid: int32[2][2] = [[1, 2], [3, 4]];        // nested
```

A local literal's elements may be any expressions; a `@static` one must be
constant (numbers, characters, string literals, or `null`), so a lookup
table lives in read-only data:

```c
@static let cmds: uint8*[][2] = [
    ["help", "show this help"],
    ["quit", "exit the program"],
];
```

`len(arr)` is the element count — a compile-time constant, handy as a loop
bound and the way to read a size you let `[]` infer. It adapts to its
context like a literal, so it compares against any integer counter (`int32`
or `uint64`) without a cast. For a multi-dimensional array, `len(grid)` is
the outer length and `len(grid[0])` the inner one:

```c
let i: int32 = 0;
while (i < len(cmds)) { use(cmds[i]); i = i + 1; }
```

Like C, an array decays to a pointer to its first element wherever a value
is used — so it passes to a `T*` parameter and `&arr[i]` gives an element
address — and there is no whole-array assignment or copy. Arrays work as
struct fields. In a type, `*` binds to the element, so `int32*[8]` is an
array of eight pointers; group for the other order. Each `N` must be a
positive integer literal (`[]` only as the inferred outermost dimension).

### Structs

`struct` declares an aggregate type; fields use the same `name: type;` form
as everything else, and structs can be generic. In type positions the
`struct` keyword is optional. `->` accesses a field through a pointer, `.`
accesses a field of a struct value, and `&` takes field addresses. `null` is
an untyped pointer constant that adapts to any pointer type, and pointers
compare with `==` / `!=`.

```c
struct point {
    x: int32;
    y: int32;
}

struct node<T> {            // generic; monomorphized like functions
    value: T;
    next: struct node<T>*;  // self-reference through a pointer
}

fn main() -> int32 {
    let p = alloc<struct point>(1);
    p->x = 3;
    let copy = *p;          // dereferencing copies the struct
    let n = copy.x + 1;
    bump(&p->x);            // address of a field
    if (p != null)
        dealloc(p);
    return 0;
}
```

`@align(N)` raises a struct's alignment to `N` bytes — a power of two; asking
for less than the natural alignment is an error. `sizeof` rounds up to a
multiple of the alignment, and field offsets and array strides stay
consistent with it, including when an aligned struct is nested inside
another:

```c
@align(64)
struct counter {     // sizeof is 64: one per cache line
    hits: uint64;
}
```

`@packed` is the opposite: it removes the padding between fields, placing
them at consecutive byte offsets, and drops the struct's alignment to 1 —
the layout for wire formats and file headers. Member accesses are compiled
as unaligned, but (as in C) taking a pointer _into_ a packed struct with
`&` and dereferencing it elsewhere is unsafe. `@packed` combines with
`@align(N)`, which then sets the overall alignment and rounds `sizeof`
back up:

```c
@packed
struct header {      // sizeof is 9, not 16
    tag: uint8;
    length: uint64;
}
```

`@volatile` marks a struct whose loads and stores must all happen exactly
as written — the optimizer may not elide, merge, or hoist them. This is for
memory-mapped hardware registers, where reading or writing _is_ the side
effect; it propagates through nested fields, and also applies to `@extern`
variables:

```c
@volatile
struct pl011 {       // a UART's register block; see examples/baremetal/
    dr: uint32;      // data register: write a byte to transmit
    ...
}
```

`sizeof` understands struct layout (including padding), so
`alloc<struct node<int32>>(n)` allocates correctly. Struct values can be
passed to and returned from functions, but not to variadic functions like
printf — pass a pointer or a field instead. See
[examples/structs.mc](examples/structs.mc) and the data structures built on
them: the growable [lib/array.mc](lib/array.mc), the open-addressing hash
table [lib/set.mc](lib/set.mc) (borrowing, identity-keyed), and the
string-keyed [lib/dict.mc](lib/dict.mc), which owns copies of its keys and
compares them by content.

### Imports

`import "file";` at the top of a file compiles another `.mc` file into the
same module. The `.mc` suffix is optional, and a file imported through
several routes (or cyclically) is only loaded once.

Imports resolve relative to the importing file first, then through the
import search path: directories added with `-I`/`--import-path` (in order),
and finally the project's [lib/](lib/) directory, which is on the path by
default so the [standard library](lib/README.md) is importable by bare name.
Pass `--naked` to leave `lib/` off the path.

```c
import "memory";       // found in lib/ via the search path
import "libc/stdio";   // libc bindings, also in lib/

fn main() -> int32 {
    let p = alloc<int32>(3);   // defined in lib/memory.mc
    ...
}
```

`import` copies the imported definitions into the module, much like a C
header. When two separately compiled objects both import the same file —
or instantiate the same generic, such as `alloc<uint8>` — that definition
lands in each object. To keep the linker from rejecting it as a duplicate,
imported and monomorphized-generic definitions are emitted with
`linkonce_odr` linkage so the identical copies merge. The file you compile
directly keeps strong linkage, so a real name clash between two such files
is still a link error.

### Visibility

Everything is public by default. Marking a function or struct `@private`
restricts it to the file that defines it — referencing it from any other
file (however it was imported) is a compile error naming the owning file:

```c
/**
 * Doubles the array's capacity. Internal; called by array_append.
 */
@private
fn array_grow<T>(self: struct array<T>*) { ... }
```

```
error: line 5: function 'array_grow' is private to array.mc
```

`@static` goes further, like C's `static`: the name is file-scoped rather
than merely access-restricted, so it leaves the global namespace entirely.
Different files can each define their own `@static` function, struct,
generic, or variable with the same name, and a file's `@static` definition
shadows a public one imported from elsewhere. From any other file the name
is simply undefined.

`@static` on a top-level `let` makes a file-scoped variable with its own
storage that persists for the life of the program — a static counter,
buffer, or lookup table. It is zero-initialized unless given a constant
initializer (see [Arrays](#arrays) for a static table):

```c
@static let calls: int32;            // starts at 0, kept across calls
@static let lookup: uint8[256];      // a static buffer

fn next_id() -> int32 { calls = calls + 1; return calls; }
```

### Extern declarations

`@extern` declares a function or global variable that is _defined
elsewhere_ — in libc, or in another object linked into the program. An
extern function gives its signature and ends with `;` instead of a body; an
extern variable is a top-level `let` with a type and no initializer:

```c
@extern
fn atoi(s: uint8*) -> int32;

@extern
let optind: int32;

fn main() -> int32 {
    return atoi("41") + optind;
}
```

A trailing `...` declares a C-style variadic function, such as `printf` or a
kernel's `printk`; extra arguments follow C's promotion rules (small integers
widen to `int32`):

```c
@extern
fn printk(fmt: uint8*, ...);
```

Extern functions cannot be generic. (A `...` is also allowed on functions you
define, which can forward their extra arguments through a `va_list` but not
read them directly — see [Variadic functions](#variadic-functions).) Identical
extern declarations may appear in any number of imported files — they all name the
same symbol — but declarations that disagree about the signature are a
compile error. `@private` applies to extern declarations as usual, and
`@volatile` marks an extern variable whose accesses must not be optimized
away; `@static` cannot be combined with `@extern`, since an external
symbol's name is fixed. (The [libc bindings](#reaching-libc) are exactly
this: files full of predeclared extern functions.)

`@symbol("name")` binds an extern to a linker symbol that differs from its mcc
name — for symbols that aren't valid identifiers, are versioned, or vary by
platform:

```c
@extern @symbol("__stdoutp") let stdout: struct FILE*;   // macOS spelling
@extern @symbol("strlen") fn length(s: uint8*) -> uint64;
```

Code still refers to the declaration by its mcc name (`stdout`, `length`); only
the emitted symbol changes.

### Strings

String literals compile to constant C strings and have type `uint8*`, so a
string is just a pointer to its bytes: it can be stored in a `uint8*`
variable, array, or struct field, indexed (`"hi"[0]` is `104`), and passed
to functions — there is no separate `string` type or built-in mutable string
storage. They support C's simple escape sequences — `\a` `\b` `\f` `\n` `\r`
`\t` `\v`, the quotes `\'` `\"`, `\\`, `\?`, and `\0` for NUL — plus `\e` for
ESC (a GCC/Clang extension, handy for ANSI terminal codes). Any other escape
keeps the bare character.

A character literal in single quotes is a `uint8` — the byte value of a
single character, using the same escapes (`'a'`, `'\n'`, `'\0'`, `'\''`,
`'\\'`). Being a plain byte, it indexes, compares, and does arithmetic like
any other `uint8`:

```c
fn digit_value(c: uint8) -> uint8 {
    return c - '0';      // '7' - '0' == 7
}
```

### Reaching libc

To call into the C library, import a binding module from
[lib/libc/](lib/libc/) — `import "libc/stdio";`, `import "libc/string";`, and
so on. These are ordinary [`@extern` declarations](#extern-declarations) for the
C functions, covering most of the standard headers (the `printf`/`scanf`
families, the `str*`/`mem*` functions, `malloc`/`qsort`/`strtol`, `FILE*`
streams, math, time, errno, …); see the
[standard library index](lib/README.md) for the full list.

```c
import "libc/stdio";
fn main() -> int32 { printf("hello\n"); return 0; }
```

Anything the bindings do not cover, you can [declare yourself](#extern-declarations)
with `@extern`. Variadic arguments to functions like `printf` follow C promotion
rules (small integers are widened to `int32`).

### Comments

```c
// line comments

/* block comments */

/**
 * Doc comments are block comments by convention, in this format:
 *
 * @param self:  array to write into
 * @param index: zero-based index; must be < self->length
 *
 * @return true on success, false if index is out of bounds
 */
```

See the [standard library index](lib/README.md) for the modules under `lib/`,
all written in this style.

## Tests

```bash
pipenv install --dev
pipenv run pytest
```

The suite in [tests/](tests/) covers each stage in isolation — token streams
([test_lexer.py](tests/test_lexer.py)), AST shapes and precedence
([test_parser.py](tests/test_parser.py)), emitted IR and compile-error
diagnostics ([test_codegen.py](tests/test_codegen.py)) — plus end-to-end
programs that JIT-compile in-process and assert on their real printf output
([test_execution.py](tests/test_execution.py)), and the command-line
interface as a subprocess ([test_cli.py](tests/test_cli.py)).

## How it works

The `mcc` package is a classic four-stage pipeline, one module per stage:

1. **[lexer.py](mcc/lexer.py)** — a single regex alternation turns source
   text into tokens, tracking line numbers for error messages.
2. **[parser.py](mcc/parser.py)** — recursive descent over the token
   stream, with precedence climbing for expressions, producing a dataclass
   AST (node classes live in [nodes.py](mcc/nodes.py)).
3. **[codegen.py](mcc/codegen.py)** — walks the AST and emits LLVM IR with
   `llvmlite.ir`: locals become `alloca` slots, strings become private global
   constants, control flow becomes basic blocks and branches, and generic
   functions are monomorphized into one LLVM function per instantiation.
4. **[driver.py](mcc/driver.py)** — resolves the `import` graph into a
   single merged program, then `llvmlite.binding` verifies the module, runs
   LLVM's pass pipeline at the requested `-O` level, and either executes
   `main` through MCJIT (`--run`) or emits an object file and links it with
   `cc`.

All compile errors are reported as `file: error: line N: message`.
